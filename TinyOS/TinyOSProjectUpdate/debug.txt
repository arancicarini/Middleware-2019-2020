DEBUG FILE

Adding debug channels:

Activate debug message on channel init
Activate debug message on channel boot
Activate debug message on channel sink
Activate debug message on channel radio
Activate debug message on channel timer
Activate debug message on channel data
Activate debug message on channel error
Activate debug message on channel treshold

Creating nodes:

Creating node: 1
>>>Will boot at time1 [sec]Creating node: 2
>>>Will boot at time1 [sec]Creating node: 3
>>>Will boot at time1 [sec]Creating node: 4
>>>Will boot at time1 [sec]Creating node: 5
>>>Will boot at time1 [sec]Creating node: 6
>>>Will boot at time1 [sec]Creating node: 7
>>>Will boot at time1 [sec]
Creating radio channels:

Setting radio channel from node: 1 to node:2,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 2 to node:1,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 3 to node:1,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 1 to node:3,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 2 to node:4,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 4 to node:2,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 2 to node:5,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 5 to node:2,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 3 to node:6,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 6 to node:3,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 3 to node:7,with gain:-60.0dBm
Setting radio channel from node: 7 to node:3,with gain:-60.0dBm

Initializing Closest Pattern Matching (CPM):

Creating noise model for node:1
