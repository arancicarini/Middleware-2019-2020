PRIMITIVES:
 - PUT(K,V): inserts/updates value V for key K;
 - GET(K): returns the value assigned to key K;
REQUIREMENTS(in practice):
 - partition the key space; 
 - assign different keys to different nodes;
 - R replicas to be (R-1) fault tolerant;
 - If a node failures, replicate the data it stored to be again (R-1) fault tolerant;
 - Leader replica to solve W/W conflicts;
 - Clients read from any replica
 - Add dinamically new nodes
ASSUMPTIONS
 - processes can fail
 - channels are reliable
